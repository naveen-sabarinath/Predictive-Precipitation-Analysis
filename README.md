# Rainfall Analysis Using Satellite Data

## Overview

This project investigates the influence of climate indices such as ENSO (El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation), PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and DMI (Dipole Mode Index) on rainfall precipitation patterns in India and Indonesia. [cite: 13, 14] These regions are heavily reliant on seasonal rainfall for agriculture and water management. [cite: 408, 409, 410, 411, 412] The study uses 20 years of data (2003-2023) and various smoothing techniques to analyze regional precipitation trends and their correlation with climate indices. [cite: 13, 14]

## Key Findings

* ENSO has a consistent and significant impact on rainfall in both India and Indonesia, with a particularly strong relationship observed in Indonesia. [cite: 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17]
* PDO and DMI have less influence on rainfall patterns compared to ENSO. [cite: 15, 16, 17]
* Seasonal correlations with ENSO show that the SON (September, October, and November) season is particularly relevant for both regions. [cite: 18]
* SARIMAX models, incorporating external climatic indices, predict rainfall in Indonesia with superior accuracy, but simpler models work best for India. [cite: 19]

## Data

The primary dataset used in this study is the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), provided by NASA. [cite: 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73] Climate index data was gathered from the following sources:

* **ENSO 3.4:** National Weather Service (NOAA) [cite: 473, 474, 475]
* **DMI:** "Laboratory" online resource [cite: 478, 479]
* **PDO:** (for Environmental Information) [cite: 481, 482]

## Methods

The project employs various data analysis and statistical techniques, including:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To understand underlying trends and seasonal variations in precipitation data. [cite: 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]
* **Smoothing Techniques:** Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter, Triangle smoothing, Gaussian smoothing, and Moving Average, to reduce noise and highlight trends in precipitation anomalies. [cite: 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 13, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196]
* **Correlation Analysis:** To quantify the relationship between rainfall and climate indices. [cite: 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539]
* **Time Series Modeling:** SARIMAX models for annual rainfall prediction. [cite: 449, 450, 451, 452, 459, 460, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281]
